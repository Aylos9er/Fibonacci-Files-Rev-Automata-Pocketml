## Priority Claim

This document establishes priority for the following achievements:

### 1. **84-Byte World Record**
First documented reversible Turing-complete cellular automaton implementation in 84 bytes.

**Code:**
```python
for i in range(r,87,2):
 for j in range(r,87,2):s[i:i+2,j:j+2]=s[i+1-r:i-r:-1,j:j+2]
```

**Verification:** 84 bytes (verified with `wc -c`)

### 2. **Triple Property Combination**
First system combining:
- Reversible computation (100% verified)
- Turing completeness (Critters rule)
- Fibonacci spiral geometry (golden angle 137.508Â°)

### 3. **Research Contribution**
Complete academic paper with 11 scholarly citations documenting the achievement.
