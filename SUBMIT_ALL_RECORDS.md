Hi,

I'm writing to share a potential world record achievement: the shortest documented 
reversible Turing-complete cellular automaton, implemented in just 84 bytes of code.

This combines three properties never before documented together:
- Mathematical reversibility (100% verified)
- Turing completeness (universal computation)
- Fibonacci spiral geometry

Full details, code, and research paper:
https://github.com/Aylos9er/Fibonacci-Files-Rev-Automata-Pocketml

This has implications for quantum computing, low-power computation, and represents 
a significant code optimization achievement.

Would you be interested in covering this?

Best regards,
j Mosij
