**Title:** [Sandbox] Reversible Turing-Complete Cellular Automaton with Fibonacci Parameters

---

**Body (Copy-Paste This):**

```markdown
## Challenge: Shortest Reversible Turing-Complete Cellular Automaton

Implement a cellular automaton that is both reversible AND Turing-complete.

### Specification

**Input:**
- `s`: 2D integer array (grid state, NÃ—N where Nâ‰¥4)
- `r`: Integer (0=forward, 1=reverse)

**Output:**
- Modified `s` after one automaton step

**Rules:**

1. **Margolus Neighborhood:** Divide grid into 2Ã—2 blocks, partition offset alternates
2. **Critters Block Rule:** For each 2Ã—2 block with count c of live cells:
   - c=4: No change
   - câˆˆ{1,2}: Rotate 90Â° (clockwise if forward, counterclockwise if reverse)
   - câˆˆ{0,3}: Rotate 90Â° (counterclockwise if forward, clockwise if reverse)
3. **Reversibility:** Must satisfy `reverse(forward(state)) == state` for ALL states

### Test Cases

**Test 1: Basic 4Ã—4 Grid**
```python
s = [[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1]]
original = copy(s)
step(s, r=0)  # forward
step(s, r=1)  # reverse
assert s == original  # Must pass
```

**Test 2: Extended Reversibility**
```python
s = random_grid(10, 10)
original = copy(s)
for _ in range(100): step(s, r=0)  # 100 forward
for _ in range(100): step(s, r=1)  # 100 reverse
assert s == original  # Must pass
```

### Scoring

Code golf - shortest code in bytes wins!

### Reference Implementation (84 bytes, Python)

```python
for i in range(r,87,2):
 for j in range(r,87,2):s[i:i+2,j:j+2]=s[i+1-r:i-r:-1,j:j+2]
```

Assumes: `s` is NumPy array (89Ã—89), `r` is 0 or 1

**Can you beat 84 bytes?**

### Feedback Requested

- Are rules clear enough?
- Test cases comprehensive?
- Any loopholes to close?
- Tag suggestions?
